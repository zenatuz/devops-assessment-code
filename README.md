# DevOps Assessment Code

## Simple time application

1 - Create an application on Go/Python that serve HTTP requests at the next routes:

- `8080:/`
- `8080:/health`

Routes should return:

- `/` - returns local time in New-York, Berlin, Tokyo in HTML format
- `/health` - return status code 200, in JSON format

2 - Dockerize your app

3 - Provision your infra using Terraform:

- VPC
- Subnets
- SGs
- Routing tables
- EKS cluster
- ECR

4 - Create and deploy Helm3 chart for your application

5 - Ensure that you have an access to the application endpoint externally

6 - Provide an external http link

7 - Upload your code to the Github public repository and provide link to us (put your code to the app, terraform, helm folders accordingly)
